                   We're a group of young, dynamic, and enthusiastic individuals from various walks of life, fed up with witnessing the unfulfilled dreams due to lack of education. With the sole purpose of improving human life and its quality, this not-for-profit organization was founded on January 15th, 2016, and is registered under Trust Act 1956. We are a nationalized NGO where our goal is to bring change in India.  At Sapne, you'll find that your work will directly benefit the children in need of education. We have also hosted several events in the presence of prominent political figures in India. As a great foundation, we strive to ignite the light of hope in the eyes of the little underprivileged children who deserve the opportunity to rise to their fullest. Sapne has launched many campaigns and events to achieve this and continues to do so each passing day.
                   There are about 2 million NGOs in India but are they all achieving what they dreamt of? Each one of us at Sapne has a passion for our beliefs and this is what fuels us every today and days to come, working for the betterment of society and we grow one step closer to accomplishing our goals each day. We at Sapne not only help people but also form a loving bond with them such that they become a part of the Sapne family. We understand that not everybody is lucky enough to afford a good education and lifestyle and we tend to be a helping hand to these people.
